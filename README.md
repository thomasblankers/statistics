Multivariate_PGLS is a script to do a MANOVA using phylogenetic correction (under Brownian motion or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) on size corrected morphological measurements.

boot.eigenvalue.variances calculates phenotypic integration as the relative variance of the eigenvalues of the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix and then bootstraps that analysis to assess significance (i.e. if the relative variance is > 0)

QTL_power_detect.r has various functions to calculate samples size, QTL detection thresholds, and true number of loci given detected QTL for intercross data
